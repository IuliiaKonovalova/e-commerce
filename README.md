## Business Model

The Business Model is B2C, meaning that the company sells products to customers only.
It focuses on individual transactions only.



### A Persona Summary of the customer

The "WoWder" store is aimed at a diverse group of people considering their needs and wants. As everyone has different needs and wants, the store provides everyone the best possible service.
The age criteria on this website are customers who are 18 and older. The emphasis was made on providing a good user experience for the customers by allowing them to find the products they are looking for, giving them all available options of these products, and offering the best possible service.

### A persona summary of the store personnel

The "Wowder" store is aimed at companies interested in selling products online. It may be a small company or a large one. Moreover, the company's potential growth is considered by implementing full personnel functionality with the ability to render all data in the store, starting from cotegories and tags and finishing product inventory and orders.

### Strategy Trade-Off

"WoWder" is an online store app that is challenging to compete with due to its wide variety of product offerings and low-cost products.

- a wide variety of product offerings;
- product availability;
- product quality;
- product choice;
- good user experience;
- good service;
- good sales;
- good customer loyalty;
- unique customer service (customer products' requests);

## Web Marketing

Newsletters were implemented in the email_notification app. The manager can create a newsletter and send it to all customers. It also handles sending newsletters about new loyalty programs with promo codes.

1. News Letter

To send a newsletter to all customers, the manager can create a newsletter and send it to all customers.
I have used Django EmailMultiAlternatives to send the newsletter.

![NewsLetter](documentation/web_marketing/newsletter.png)

2. Promo Codes

To send a newsletter about new loyalty programs with promo codes to all customers, the manager can create a newsletter using the same form with a promo code field filled with a legend. Django EmailMultiAlternatives is also responsible for it.

![Promo Codes](documentation/web_marketing/promo_email.png)

3. Facebook

Facebook is essential for the store to be able to reach customers. According to the statistics, the store has a good reach among people who prefer to use Facebook. Facebook has excellent coverage worldwide among people who can purchase products online.

"WoWder" Facebook page is for marketing purposes to post adverts and exciting content and engage users.

[WoWder Facebook Page](documentation/web_marketing/wowder_facebook_mockup.pdf)

4. Instagram

Instagram attracts people of younger ages and is essential for the store to be able to reach this age group. According to the statistics, 90% of Instagram users are under 35 years old. [See report](https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/communications-division/digital-communications-team/assets/documents/guides/A-Guide-To-Social-Media-Platforms-and-Demographics.pdf)

"WoWder" Instagram page is for marketing purposes to post adverts, interesting content, and engage users.

[WoWder Instagram Page](documentation/web_marketing/wowder_instagram_mockup.pdf)

5. Twitter

Twitter has become a place for people from different backgrounds to meet and discuss various topics! That is why "WoWder" presence is also essential on this platform.

"WoWder" Twitter page is for marketing purposes to post adverts, and exciting content, and start the discussion about the shop itself.

## Future Development

#### Techsupport chat

Chat support is planned to be implemented to provide the customers with the best possible service.

My application is already using ASGI instead of WSGI. Thus, it would be easier to implement chat support using Django Channels and Redis channel layers in the future.

#### Sorting products by rating and reviews

This feature is fully dependent on the business requirements. And not all business requirements include this feature due to the customers' personal preferences.
#### Third-party registration

Facebook and Twitter were not considered for future development at this stage as they require additional information from the business. 
Google is the most popular third-party registration service that is easy to implement; however, it is not available in all countries and regions (like China).

#### Payment system

I want to implement PayPal payment system in the future as many customers prefer it. I am also considering adding Alipay and WeChat payment functionality to the existing stripe payment system as they are widely used in Asian countries like China and Thailand.

#### Suppliers app

I want to add the suppliers' app in the future as it is a significant part of the business. The suppliers' app is a platform for businesses to manage suppliers and products they offer customers. It will highly increase the business' productivity and sales.
The models for this app have already been planned and described in the DB architecture tables.

#### Order cancellation

This feature requires more research time to implement, which is why it is not implemented at this stage.

#### Elastic search

Elastic search is necessary for the future development of the application as it may increase the search speed and the quality of search results.


This decision to postpone the this feature's implementation was necessary to make as a developer, I have to evaluate the necessity of all features and estimate the time for the development process and the time for the implementation of the features. Moreover, it is crucial to know the exact operating procedure of a real business. For example, understanding the business's product prioritization to set up the recommendation functionality will play a crucial role in the implementation process. Thus, I would like to leave those features as the opportunity to future learning and development.

#### Delivery cost calculation

This interesting feature has kept me curious during the development process as there are many different ways to calculate the delivery cost. At this stage, I decided to go with the idea of free delivery based in all Chinese e-commerce stores, where the cost is already included in the product's price. However, to make the application more flexible, I would like to consider the possibility of different delivery cost calculation methods and plan to consult with logistics specialists to get all the necessary information. We have to take into consideration various factors such as:

1. The shipping company fees;
2. the actual distance between a shop warehouse and the customer's address;
3. The total weight of the products in the order;
4. The parameters of the package (size, weight, etc.);
5. The value of the products in the order (whether the order includes golden jewelry, TV, etc.);
6. Payment method (whether the customer is paying with a credit card, PayPal, etc.);
7. Tax rate;
8. If the customer is located abroad, the border tax rate;
9. Option to deliver by courier or by self-service;
10. etc.

## Features


Please refer to the [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) file for all test-related documentation.

## Design

The design of the application is based on Material Design principles. The colors are chosen to be consistent with the [Material Design principles](https://www.creative-tim.com/blog/web-design/12-absolute-principles-material-design/)
The minimalistic approach was used to create something meaningful without moving out of the customer's focus. As this application is a multifunctional (provides full customer experience and business management) application and consists of many components, the decision to implement white spaces was made as it helps to create a more pleasant user experience. It also helps users, whether customers or personnel, to focus on the main content of the application.

### Color Scheme

The application's color scheme is based on the combination of bold and neutral colors. The bold colors are used to create a more vibrant and attractive user experience. The neutral colors are used to create a more calm and relaxed user experience.

  ![Color Scheme](documentation/design/colors_main.png)

The navbar and footer are colored with a dark purple color (`#151422`) to emphasize the application's main content. The navbar for admin was colored with the purplish color (`#4f378b`) to separate is from the main navbar and put an accent on the admin functionality. It also helps personnel to distinguish that they enter as personnel.

The color scheme for the text is quite simple to create a more readable user experience.

  ![Text Scheme](documentation/design/colors_text.png)

As the application is highly complex and has lots of functionality, I have decided to implement accent colors to help users navigate the application. The accent colors are used to create a more vibrant and attractive user experience.

  ![Accent Scheme](documentation/design/color_accent.png)

### Typography
The main font used in the application is Lato. During my learning experience, I found that the Lato font is straightforward and has perfect readability, increasing user experience. This font is also consistent with the color scheme.

  ![Typography](documentation/design/lato_400.png)

  ![Typography](documentation/design/lato_700.png)

  ![Typography](documentation/design/lato_900.png)

To emphasize the importance of the text, the font-weight was set to 900. To make the accent on the buttons, the font-weight was set to 700. For the rest of the text, the font-weight was set to 400.

### Imagery

- The main background image was generated with the user of the [BGJar](https://www.bgjar.com/) tool.

  ![Background](documentation/design/background.svg)

- Images were downloaded from the websites listed in the **Credits section**. [Content and Images](#content-and-images)

- The main part is allocated to using icons from the [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website. Icons are essential for the user experience when it comes to multifunctional websites.

## Agile Methodology

### GitHub Project Management

  ![GitHub Project Management](documentation/agile/github_project_management.png)

GitHub Project Management was used to manage the project. If it hadn't been for the GitHub project management, I wouldn't have been able to manage the development of the application. It helped me to prioritize the tasks and to keep track of my progress.

## Flowcharts

To understand some concepts, I created several flowchart diagrams.

1. Sending stock email notifications to users who have left a request for a particular product inventory.

[Flowchart](documentation/flowcharts/stock_email_notifications_flowchart.pdf)

2. Get discount after applying the coupon code for loyalty program.

[Flowchart](documentation/flowcharts/get_promo_price_flowchart.pdf)

3. Payment system.

## Information Architecture

### Database

* During the earliest stages of the project, the database was created using SQLite.
* The database was then migrated to PostgreSQL.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram

### Data Modeling

#### Role Model
| Name          | Database Key  | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| name          | name          | CharField    | max_length=50, unique=True, blank=True, null=False, verbose_name='Role name' |
| description   | description   | TextField    | max_length=500, blank=True, null=True, verbose_name='Role description' |



#### Profile Model

When user signs up, a new profile is created. 

| Name          | Database Key  | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| user          | user          | OneToOneField | User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='profile', verbose_name='User' |
| first_name    | first_name    | CharField    | max_length=50, blank=True, null=True, verbose_name='First name' |

| updated_at    | updated_at    | DateTimeField | auto_now=True, verbose_name='Updated at' |

**Note:** The role field is set to 1 by default. This is because the user is a customer by default. The role can be changed only from the admin panel. The decision to make it mandatory was made due to the store security reasons. **Only the site admin can change the role of the user in order to prevent unauthorized access.**

#### Address Model

Users are encouraged to create their own addresses and set the default address for the fastest purchase.
